    "1. The Goal\n",
    "    We want the model to learn how to predict the next word in a sequence of text.\n",
    "To do that, we need to turn our long vector of words (202,646 tokens) into training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Sliding Window\n",
    "    The function create_sequences(text, seq_length) creates a sliding window of length seq_length (say 100) across the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each position i:\n",

    "        Input sequence (X) = tokens from i to i + seq_length\n",
    "        Target sequence (Y) = the same tokens but shifted one step to the right\n",

    "    So the model is asked:\n",
    "    👉 “If you see this chunk of text, what comes next?”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example (small numbers)\n",
    "    If text = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and seq_length = 3:\n",

    "`class TransformerBlock(tf.keras.layers.Layer):`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like one \"layer\" of thinking. The full model will stack multiple of these together. Each block does two main things:\n",
    "1. Multi-Head Attention - \"What should I pay attention to?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.att = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim)\n",
    "attn_output = self.att(inputs, inputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the magic sauce! It looks at every word in the sentence and asks: \"Given this word, which other words in the sentence are most important right now?\"\n",
    "For example, in \"The cat that was sleeping soundly woke up\", when processing \"woke\", the attention mechanism figures out that \"cat\" is super important (not \"sleeping\" or \"soundly\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feed-Forward Network - \"Now let me think about what I learned\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.ffn = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    Dense(ff_dim, activation=\"relu\"),  # Expand and process\n",
    "    Dense(embed_dim)                   # Compress back down\n",
    "])`\n",
    "\n",
    "After figuring out what to pay attention to, it does some deeper processing - like \"OK, I know 'cat' and 'woke' are connected, now what does that actually mean?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Skip Connections and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "`out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attn_output)  # Add original input back\n",
    "return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output)     # Add again`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is brilliant engineering - it keeps adding the original input back in. Why? Because it prevents the \"telephone game\" effect where information gets garbled as it passes through many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: TransformerModel - The Full Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.embedding = Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts words to numbers. \"cat\" might become [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...] - a vector that captures the \"essence\" of what \"cat\" means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional Encoding - \"Where am I in the sentence?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.pos_encoding = self.positional_encoding(seq_length, embed_dim)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the weird part: the attention mechanism has no concept of word order! \"Cat dog\" and \"dog cat\" look identical to it. So we need to manually inject position information.\n",
    "The positional encoding uses sine and cosine waves to create a unique \"fingerprint\" for each position:\n",
    "\n",
    "Position 0: [sin(0), cos(0), sin(0), cos(0), ...]\n",
    "Position 1: [sin(1), cos(1), sin(1/100), cos(1/100), ...]\n",
    "Position 2: [sin(2), cos(2), sin(2/100), cos(2/100), ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Why sine/cosine? Because they create smooth, predictable patterns that help the model understand \"this word comes before that word.\"\n",
    "The Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "`def call(self, inputs, training=False):\n",
    "    x = self.embedding(inputs)           # Words → numbers\n",
    "    x += self.pos_encoding[:, :seq_len, :] # Add position info\n",
    "    for transformer_block in self.transformer_blocks:\n",
    "        x = transformer_block(x, training=training)  # Stack multiple layers\n",
    "    output = self.dense(x)               # Final prediction`\n",
    "    \n",
    "What This Model Actually Does\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes in: A sequence of word IDs like [45, 123, 67, 891] (representing \"The cat is sleeping\")\n",
    "Converts: Each ID to a rich vector representation\n",
    "Adds: Position information so it knows word order\n",
    "Processes: Through multiple transformer blocks, each one getting better at understanding context\n",
    "Outputs: Predictions for what the next word should be\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Architecture is Genius\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Processing: Unlike older models that had to process words one-by-one, this can look at all words simultaneously\n",
    "Long-Range Dependencies: It can connect \"The cat\" with \"woke up\" even with lots of words in between\n",
    "Scalable: You can make it smarter by adding more layers or making the embeddings bigger\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole thing is essentially a very sophisticated autocomplete system that's learned incredibly nuanced patterns about how language works!"
